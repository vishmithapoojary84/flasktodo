      <h1>About This To-Do Website</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my personal To-Do website! This project was created as a way to help you manage tasks, stay organized, and keep track of your daily goals. As a solo developer, I wanted to build a simple, easy-to-use platform that can help people like you get things done efficiently.</p>
      
      <h2>My Story</h2>
      <p>I built this website out of a personal need to stay organized. As someone juggling multiple tasks, I realized there was a need for a simple tool that could help me stay on top of my daily to-do list. Rather than using complex task management systems, I wanted something straightforward and user-friendly. And that's how this website came to life!</p>

      <h2>Features</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>Create, edit, and delete tasks</li>
          <li>Set due dates and deadlines</li>
          <li>Simple, minimalistic design</li>
          <li>Track your progress and stay productive</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Vision</h2>
      <p>My vision for this website is to offer a tool that simplifies task management without unnecessary complexity. I believe staying organized should be easy and accessible to everyone, and that's the goal of this project â€” to make task management as simple as possible!</p>
